    <h1>About Baby Monitor App</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>Baby Monitor App</strong> is designed to provide parents with
      peace of mind by allowing them to monitor their baby using a Raspberry Pi
      device. The app connects to your Raspberry Pi over your local Wi-Fi
      network to stream live audio and video, helping you keep an eye on your
      little one in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike cloud-based baby monitors, this app prioritizes your privacy — all
      communication happens entirely within your local network (LAN), meaning
      your data never leaves your home.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Local-only live audio and video streaming</li>
      <li>Noise level graph with customizable alerts</li>
      <li>Lightweight design and simple setup</li>
      <li>No internet connection or third-party servers required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create a safe, private, and user-friendly monitoring
      experience for families who value control and data security.
    </p>

    <h2>Developer</h2>
    <p>
      This app was developed by <strong>Nikos Varelas</strong> as an independent
      project focused on open, privacy-conscious technology. For more apps and
